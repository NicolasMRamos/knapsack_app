# University Project - 0/1 Knapsack App

## Description

This group project consists on an "app" I developed for the *Desenho de Algoritmos* (DA) class in my second year, second semester in FEUP.

This app solves the "0/1 Knapsack Problem" applied to a real life situation (loading and selection of pallets for a truck), with support for 4 different algorithmic approaches.

It includes:
--> Menu system
--> CSV dataset loading
--> The following approaches:
* Brute Force + Backtracking
* Greedy
* Dynamic Programming
* ILP

## Setup Instructions for ILP

Run this in the terminal for the ILP algorithm:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
